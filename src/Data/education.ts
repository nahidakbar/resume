      "I reflected on and re-assessed my career. I decided to focus career development towards engineering leadership, communication and softer aspects of product development. I wanted to both diversify my knowledge and acquire relevant theoretical foundation in management. I found that MBA complemented my engineering experience well. It enhanced the strategic dimension of my thinking. It helped me focus more on what is important in projects; helped me relate to customers and their needs and wants more; and gave a path I have taken to continuously make myself a better leader and team player.",

      "Programming has been a long term hobby for me. I have been hacking together HTML and JavaScript in FrontPage since I was exposed in high school. When working in school website and newspaper wasn't enough, I turned my retro games hobby into emulator and middleware programming to be able to inject macros and be able to play with friends over network. I shocked everyone when I came third in New Zealand's Net Guide High School level web design competition in year nine with a team of one. I also liked maths and physics and started my undergrad journey to be an Electrical Engineer. Despite thinking I was a really good programmer at the time, I realised how little I knew of programming through its mandatory programming courses. I realised that solving problems with software was my passion. I changed my degree to software engineering. My degree gave me the theoretical foundation and confidence to tackle any software projects.",
    thesis:
      "My industrial projects included developing software for 3G femtocell as part of a team of five in third year and leading a team of four student engineers to produce a metadata entry tool in my final year."
