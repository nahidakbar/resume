/**

I have:

- A can do attitude and experience in full SDLC roles. 
- Strong ability to adapt technologically and research skills  gained through over ten years of project experience and university study. I enjoy learning new subjects and ideas to solve my problems in both efficient and effective ways.
- Highly developed organisational and time management skills â€“ able to plan, manage and juggle multiple responsibilities to achieve objectives.
- Strong leadership capabilities and is a supportive team player. Enjoy taking initiatives to achieve set goals and can work independently with minimal supervision.
- Excellent communication and interpersonal skills with experience relating to technical and non-technical people on all levels and work in multi-disciplinary project teams.
- Advanced computing and written communication skills with experience in writing different types of technical documentation and consulting with stakeholders.
- Strong interest and involvement in professional development activities.

I am a polyglot. I have general preference for flatter organisations, cultures and teams - the type of environment where people manage themselves and take initiatives to do amazing things. I also like working with people who like taking ownership of projects as a whole (not their small part), who prefer to step outside the box by default and can appreciate the following inequality: software engineering >> coding + testing.
